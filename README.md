# AI-Based Medical Image Severity Analysis and Smart Clinic Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates the application of **AI Problem Solving Techniques** in the healthcare domain. The system allows users to upload a medical image, analyzes the severity of the condition using AI-based inference and heuristic reasoning, visualizes the evaluation through graphs, and recommends suitable nearby clinics and doctors

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply AI problem-solving techniques to a real-world healthcare scenario  
- Analyze uploaded medical images without dataset training  
- Classify severity levels (Low / Medium / High)  
- Provide explainable AI outputs using evaluation graphs  
- Recommend clinics and doctors using rule-based AI logic  
- Design a creative and effective hospital-themed UI/UX  

---

## 🧠 AI Problem Solving Techniques Used
- Problem Decomposition  
- Heuristic Reasoning  
- Rule-Based Expert System  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Intelligent Decision Making  

---

## 🏥 System Features
- Medical image upload and preview  
- AI-based severity analysis  
- Confidence score generation  
- Evaluation graphs for explainability  
- Clinic and doctor recommendations  
- Hospital-themed, user-friendly UI  

---

## 🔄 System Workflow
1. User uploads a medical image  
2. Image preprocessing (resize, normalization)  
3. Feature extraction using pre-trained or simulated AI  
4. Severity classification (Low / Medium / High)  
5. Confidence score calculation  
6. Evaluation graph generation  
7. Clinic and doctor recommendation  
8. Results displayed on the UI  

---

## 🖥️ UI / UX Design
- Hospital-themed background  
- Medical color palette (blue, white, green)  
- Clean and responsive layout  
- Visual severity indicators  
- Graph-based explainability  

---

## 🧪 Severity Classification Logic
| Severity Level | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| Low | Minor condition, general consultation required |
| Medium | Moderate condition, specialist consultation advised |
| High | Serious condition, multispecialty hospital required |

---

## 🏨 Clinic & Doctor Recommendation Logic
- **Low Severity** → General Clinic → General Physician  
- **Medium Severity** → Specialty Clinic → Specialist Doctor  
- **High Severity** → Multispecialty Hospital → Senior Consultant  

This recommendation is implemented using **IF–THEN rule-based AI logic**.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
### Frontend
